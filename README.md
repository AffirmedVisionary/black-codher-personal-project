## Project Structure

This is the structure of the project

- README.md
- client
- server

### client

The client folder is where you will store your front end code. Currently this contains a new project created with create-react-app.

Put your react code here

### server

The server folder is where you will store your back end code. This currently contains a json file with some fake data, and it is where you'll add your node.js code.

Put your node code here
